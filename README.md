Hi.
Thanks for reading my assignment.

The Assignment was written on the latest version of .net 6.
The program has a controller, which has twe functions.
A function which only counts the results, and a function which gets the query to search for, and pagination info.

Paging is done on the server side, just like google itself.
The search uses MongoDB search text, and sorts the results by score.

The application uses dependency injection for loosely coupled, and uses a configuration file.
